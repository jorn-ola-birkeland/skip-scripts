"""This script checks login activity on the system and warns on Slack if a new login is detected.
Version: 2024-03-07_01
Dependencies: subprocess and slack_sdk (install with: pip3 install slack_sdk)
Tested on python 3.10.12 and python 3.6.8 with slack_sdk v3.27.0.
Make a notifier_config.py file with the following content:
HOSTNAME = "your-hostname"
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
The WEBHOOK URL can be obtained at https://api.slack.com/apps/A06KXH9GGAJ/incoming-webhooks?
Suggested installation method: add the script to the crontab to run every minute.
